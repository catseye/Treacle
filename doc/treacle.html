<h1>The Treacle Programming Language</h1>

<p>Language version 1.0.<br/>
Chris Pressey, Cat's Eye Technologies</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><dfn>Treacle</dfn> is a programming language based on an extended form of term-rewriting
which we shall call, somewhat innacurately (or at least arbitrarily,) <em>context rewriting</em>.</p>

<p>Like Arboretuum, its successor built around <em>forest-rewriting</em>, Treacle was intended as
a language for specifying compilers.  Treacle is somewhat more successful at pulling it off, however;
context rewriting encompasses, and is more expressive than, forest-rewriting.</p>

<p><dfn>Context rewriting</dfn> is meant to refer to the fact that Treacle's rewriting patterns
may contain <dfn>holes</dfn> – designated "containers" for subpatterns which may match not just
the <em>immediate</em> child of the term which the parent pattern matched (as in conventional term-rewriting)
but also <em>any one of that child's descendents</em>, no matter how deeply nested.</p>

<p>When a hole is matched to some term, that term is searched for the
subpattern given inside the hole.  The search may be performed in either
leftmost-innermost or leftmost-outermost order; this is specified
by a qualifier associated with the hole.  Because of this, Treacle need not
specify a language-wide reduction order; the hole construct acts as a kind of
search operator which explicitly encodes search order into each pattern.</p>

<p>Context rewriting also deconstructs the conventional concept of the variable,
splitting it into a <dfn>name</dfn> and a <dfn>wildcard</dfn>.  Any pattern or
subpattern may be named, not just wildcards.  Even holes may be named.  At the same time,
wildcards, which match arbitrary terms, may occur unnamed.  Upon a successful match,
only those terms which matched named patterns are recorded in the unifier.</p>

<p>Further, each rule in Treacle may contain multiple terms (<dfn>replacements</dfn>) on the right-hand side
of a rewriting rule, and each of these may have its own name.  When the term undergoing rewriting
(called the <dfn>subject</dfn>) is rewritten, each named replacement is substituted into the subject at the position
matched by the part of the pattern that is labelled by that same name.</p>

<p>Lastly, replacements may contain special atomic terms called <dfn>newrefs</dfn>.  When a
newref is written into the subject, it takes the form of a new, unique symbol, guaranteed (or at least
reasonably assumed) to be different from all other symbols that are in, or could be in, the subject.
When multiple newrefs (possibly in multiple replacements) in the same rule are written into the subject
at the same time (i.e., on the same rewriting step,)
they all take the same form (and so are equal to each other, and only to each other – nothing else.)  In Treacle's
capacity as a compiler-definition language, newrefs are useful for generating internal labels for,
e.g., translating control structures to machine code jumps.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that, while subpatterns may be nested in holes, and these
may in turn contain more holes, there is no corresponding hierarchical nature to the <em>bindings</em>
which occur in Treacle patterns: all variables of the same name must unify to equivalent terms, regardless of where they
occur in the pattern (inside or outside a hole.)</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>We're almost ready to give some examples to elucidate all this, but first we need a
syntax to give them in.  Here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>atoms are denoted by strings of lower-case letters;</li>
<li>terms are denoted by lists of subterms inside parentheses;</li>
<li>named terms are denoted by <code>(? <var>name</var> <var>subterm</var>)</code>;</li>
<li>holes are denoted by <code>(:i <var>subterm</var>)</code> or <code>(:o <var>subterm</var>)</code>,
corresponding to innermost and outermost search order, respectively;</li>
<li>wildcards are denoted by <code>*</code>;</li>
<li>newrefs are denoted by <code>@</code>; and</li>
<li>named replacements are denoted <code>X : <var>term</var></code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Now we are ready to give some examples.</p>

<h3>Patterns</h3>

<ul>
<li>The pattern <code>(a b (? X *))</code> matches <code>(a b (c (d b)))</code>, with the unifier
<code>X=(c (d b))</code>.  Also, <code>(a (? Y *) (c (d (? Y *))))</code> matches the same subject
with <code>Y=b</code>.  This is all quite conventional.</li>

<li>We can also match <code>(a (? X b) *)</code> to this subject.  The unifier will <em>always</em> be
<code>X=b</code> when this pattern matches, regardless of the subject.  This tells us nothing we
did not already know.  But it demonstrates the decoupling of names and wildcards in Treacle.  (It will also become useful when we get to replacements, since that atomic <code>b</code> term named by <code>X</code>
can be supplanted by something: we have named not just a subterm, but a location in the subject.)</li>

<li>The pattern <code>(a b (:i (d b)))</code> matches the subject as well.
Observe how the hole allowed <code>(d b)</code> to be sought
inside the subterm at the location where the hole matched.
Note also that the pattern would just as easily match the subject
<code>(a b (w x (w y (w z (d b)))))</code>, because it doesn't matter how
deep <code>(d b)</code> is embedded in the subterm.</li>

<li>If the pattern included a name, like <code>(a b (? X (:i (d b))))</code>,
the match with the subject would result in the unifier <code>X=(c (d b))</code>.
Likewise, the pattern <code>(a b (:i (? X (d b))))</code> would match the subject
with the unifier <code>X=(d b)</code>.</li>

<li>The pattern <code>(a (? X *) (:i (d (? X *))))</code> also matches the
subject, with the unifier <code>X=b</code>.  This is a good example of the
expressive power of pattern-matching in Treacle: we are basically asking
to search the contents of the 3rd subterm, for whatever the 2nd subterm is.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>

<li>Say we have a rule where the pattern is <code>(a b (:i (? X (d b))))</code>,
and the lone replacement is <code>X : a</code>.  This rule would match the
original subject <code>(a b (c (d b)))</code>, unifying with <code>X=(d b)</code>,
and would rewrite the subject to <code>(a b (c a))</code>.</li>

<li>Or, say our rule's pattern is <code>(a (? Y *) (:i (? X (d *))))</code>,
and the set of replacements is {<code>X : (? Y)</code>, <code>Y : (? X)</code>}.
This rule would also match the subject, with a unifier of {<code>X=(d b)</code>,
<code>Y=b</code>}, and would rewrite the subject to <code>(a (d b) (c b))</code>.
Again, notice the expressivity of this rule: we're basically asking Treacle to swap whatever
occurs next to the <code>a</code>, with whatever occurs alongside a <code>d</code>
somewhere inside the term that occurs next to that.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mechanism</h2>

<p>We can think of the mechanism by which context rewriting is undertaken, as follows.</p>

<p>We pattern-match "as usual": recursively traverse the pattern and the subject.  Where there are
literals in the pattern, we make sure those same values appear in the subject, in the same place.
Where there are named subpatterns in the pattern, we bind the name to the position in the subject, and
insert that binding into a unifier, before trying to match the subpattern to that position.
(We do an occurs check first, to make sure that the name isn't already bound to something else.)</p>

<p>Note that we bind the name, not to a subterm in the subject, but to a <em>position</em> in the subject.
If you like, you can think of context rewriting building a "unifier by reference" rather than the rather
more conventional "unifier by value".  This is useful, because the presence of holes means that we will
have more of a need to know where we want to install a replacement.</p>

<p>When we encounter a hole in the pattern, we take the subpattern that appears in the hole
and begin searching for that subpattern in the subterm of the subject whose position corresponds
to the hole.  We pass this subsearch our unifier (so that it can use the variable bindings already
established for occurs checks.)  If the subsearch fails to match, then we also fail to match.
If the subsearch succeeds, we continue the pattern-matching process with the unifier it produced.</p>

<p>If everything succeeds, we have a unifier.  We go through the replacements, look up the name
of each replacement in the unifier to find the location in the subject where it matched, expand all the
variable names in the replacement with the contents of the unifier, and "poke" the expanded replacement
into the subject at the location.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Like Arboretuum, there is a reference implementation of Treacle in relatively pure Scheme, meant to
normatively fill in any gaps in the description of the language given in this document.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>You may wonder, why forest-rewriting, or context rewriting?  To be sure, it does not add any
computational power to term-rewriting, which is already Turing-complete.  But it does add a significant
amount of expressiveness.  While this expressiveness seems to come at a signficant cost (at least,
as imagined in a naïve implementation,) there are two advantages it might provide, one practical
and one theoretical, which I'll get to in a second.</p>

<p>The idea latent in forest-rewriting, which I didn't explain too well in the Arboretuum documentation,
is to <em>partition the subject</em>.  Context rewriting continues and generalizes this idea;
while in forest-rewriting it is obvious what the partitions are (named trees in a forest,) in
context-rewriting, the partitions would be subterms of some given term (for example, the top-level
term.)  An engine implementing context-rewriting might need some supplementary information
or deductive ability in order to "see" and exploit the partitions, but they could nonetheless be
identified.</p>

<p>One major effect of partitioning is to ease the locality constraint.  If you've ever tried programming
in pure term-rewriting, you notice that you have to "keep all your state together": if there are
multiple pieces of information in the tree of terms that relate to the reduction you want to accomplish,
they have to be in a bounded distance from, and in a fixed relationship with, each other.
If some piece is far away, it will have to be brought – <em>literally</em> brought! –
to bear on the situation, by moving it through the tree through successive "bubbling" rewrites.</p>

<p>Forest-rewriting eases this by having multiple independent trees: some piece of information
can be anywhere in some other tree.  Context rewriting eases it by having holes in which the
piece of information can be found anywhere.</p>

<p>Partitioning the subject could have the practical benefit of improving locality of reference
in the rewriting engine.  Each partition can reside in its own memory buffer which is fixed in
some way, for example in one or more cache lines.  Since we don't need to "bubble" information
through the term, each partition can stay in its own cached area, and we should see fewer
cache misses.</p>

<p>Partitioning the subject could also have the theoretical benefit of making it easier
to prove that the rewriting terminates,  If you look through some of the unit tests
in <code>tests.scm</code>, you might notice that some of them go to some lengths to avoid
rewriting certain trees to anything larger than they were.
The size of each partition is then monotonically decreasing, and so it will eventually "run out",
at which point the rewriting process must of course terminate.  We might not be able to
achieve the ideal case where, on each rewrite, at least one of the partitions shrinks and the
rest stay the same size. The closer we can come to it, however, the less burdensome should be
the task of proving that the entire system terminates, because many of the cases should
be trivial.</p>

<p>Happy whacky rewriting all sorts of fun ways!
